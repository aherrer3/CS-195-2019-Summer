    	<h1>My Choices</h1>
    	<p>During the completion of this project for my business, I made a series of choices. Since I was working alone and completing a site for my own personal business, all the choices were indeed mine to make</p>

    	<p>
    		In terms of choices many of them were functional and stylist, in order to meet the project requirements as well as to create the first version of a usable site for my business with my given skill set as I was working alone
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		The first choice is made was on the site's layout, since the project shareholder, also me, wanted the possible of developing a mobile friendly site, instead of creating two version and to avoid using media queries, I decided the best course of action would be to implement the grid system of Bootstrap. By using this, the grid adapt based on the screen size thus making the site usable on mobile devices. I wanted a nice neutral theme without any major bridge colors so I stuck with the dark slate theme. I wanted a clean user UI with all information clearly labeled in order ot adhere to the rules of ueabilty where each click is mindless. 
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		In order to meet my goal of a clean user UI, I started with a constant nav bar with defined links to each bag. As for those pages, I made decisions based on the one where major points I wanted the site to address and how can I diaplay that to a user with the key aspect of implemting as much JavaScript as I can given this ia JavaScript based course.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    		In order to meet tha JavaScript requriement, I implemented them in the following ways. 
    		<ol>
<li>Form Validation: JS is used in order to valid the contact for when it is submitted</li>
<li>Popout: In order to shorten the page for the contact form, buttons are used to hide the forms from users who arent looking for that feature<li>
	<li>Google Maps API: Using this API, I thought would be the most useful and effective way in order to show our business's locations</li>
    		</ol>
    	</p>
    	<p>Now I give you my <a href="final/dev/index.php">site</a> , please enjoy thank you!</p>
